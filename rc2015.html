You&#39;ll learn practices for examining how code might harm individuals. We&#39;ll look at how to flip the paradigm, for consequences that are better for all.</td></tr>

You can customize it to fit your preferred tools, too. Soon, you&#39;ll be on your way to having more consistent tests that are much more fun to maintain!</td></tr>

Most importantly, we&#39;ll see how these data structures are useful in real-life programming scenarios.
